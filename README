This is a programm, that can shuffle and unshuffle the only ASCII charactars in random way.

USAGE:
1) make
2) ./shuffle "The text you want to shuffle"
2) ./unshuffle

The output will be in your command line (you can also change it with opening a new file and changing the fd to write the result)
Despites, you can change the names of files, such as key.txt and shuffled.txt only giving the new names in .h files of shuffle and unshuffle programs

IT'S IMPORTANT:
- to give the names ".txt" at the end of the names of the changed files
